# Hardware

* These code are implemented for Bluno Beetles, including gloves, vests, and legs.
* EEPROM library is utilized to store and assign a player ID to the Beetles. For initialization, the EEPROM section of the code is uncommented and uploaded only once to a new Beetle. After the player ID is stored in the EEPROM, the code can be uploaded again without needing to modify the stored ID, as it persists across uploads.
